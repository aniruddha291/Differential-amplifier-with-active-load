Differential amplifier design with active load using PDM 

    ◦ Designed a differential amplifier with an active load using the potential division method (PDM) in Cadence Virtuoso , targeting a gain
    of 40 dB , gain bandwidth product of 50 MHz and a slew rate of 5V/μsec , with precise transistor sizing and biasing to meet these specifi-
    cations
    ◦ Performance verification includes DC,AC and transient analysis to ensure the design meets the desired outcomes
